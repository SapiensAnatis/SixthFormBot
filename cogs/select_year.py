Year selection cog

This cog enables users to get the role according to which
year they're in, again by entering a command.

I could've used reactions, but if we have a command for this then in theory the
#lobby chat can almost be eliminated.

Configuration:

YEARS -- a list of all the year role names.
ROLES -- a dictionary containing the Discord.Role objects. It is generated at
startup by searching for roles with the names in YEARS, and indexing them with
those names.

Roles are pre-fetched at startup to save the program from having to use
utils.find excessively every time a command is run. Effectively, roles are loaded
into memory to reduce read times.
